**React Native Package Manager** built to ease your daily React Native development. Inspired by `CocoaPods`, `fastlane` and `react-native link` it acts as your best friend and guides you through the native unknowns. It aims to work with almost all packages available with no extra configuration required.

> RNPM should always be run in projects that use **version control** to ensure any changes made can be easily reverted

## Requirements

- node >= 4.1

## Getting started

#### Installation
```bash
$ npm install rnpm -g
```

#### Running

**Installing dependency:**

If you want to install a dependency and link it in one run:
```bash
$ rnpm install <name>
```

**Linking dependency:**

If you already have some installed (but not linked) modules, run:
```bash
$ rnpm link
```
In the case you want to link only one dependency, you can specify its name as an argument:
```bash
$ rnpm link <name>
```

## Rationale

Why? Tooling is important. We all know this. One of the biggest advantages of native iOS development is Xcode and its great tools. Unfortunately, the process of adding native dependencies to React Native projects is far from perfect and our aim is to make it fun again.

React Native Package Manager provides you with (soon) multiple actions to help you with daily development, including automatic app store releases, over-the-air integration with AppHub and react-native-playground shares.

**But hey, we are tired of tools and 9000+ .rc files**

So are we. That's why we have spent great amount of work on getting configuration done right. Our packager automatically scans your source directory and dependencies you are working with. This approach allows it to link all the things without supplying any extra configuration. It detects Android package names, import paths, gradle location - and for iOS - it works with any code structure you have ever came up with.

And don't worry - in case it fails, you can always add `rnpm` object to your `package.json` - our `npm` in a name is not a mistake! We embrace existing ecosystem and integrate with the present tooling for maximum developer experience.

## Available commands

#### rnpm link [name]
Automatically updates your project by linking all dependencies for Android (if present) and for iOS (if present). It's a great fit to your `postinstall` hook to always make sure you are linked. You can supply optional [name] argument to link only one dependency, e.g.

```bash
$ npm install react-native-module --save
$ rnpm link react-native-module
```

Source: https://github.com/rnpm/rnpm-plugin-link

#### rnpm install [name]
Automatically installs the given package and links it to your project. It's equivalent to running the previous example. It's just instead of running two commands, you can now just:

```bash
$ rnpm install react-native-module
```

Source: https://github.com/rnpm/rnpm-plugin-install

## Advanced usage
If you're authoring an awesome react-native library with custom assets, you probably need an additional step after linking - copying assets to the application folder. Well, that's not complicated: just add `rnpm` section in your `package.json` file:
```json
...
"rnpm": {
  "assets": ["Fonts"]
},
...
```
We'll copy your assets carefully with love for Android :heart: For iOS, we will add files to `Resources` group and update Info.plist so fonts are available for you to use straight away!

## Plugins

As of version 1.1.0, rnpm supports plugin system. It allows you to write your own / use third-party commands to make your `rnpm` sharpened for specific purposes.

#### Installing plugins

In order to install 3rd party plugin simply run below from your project directory:
```bash
$ npm install rnpm-plugin-<name> --save-dev
$ rnpm --help # you'll see installed plugin in the commands list
```

Command exported by installed plugin will be available straight away.

#### Mastering your first plugin

First of all, every plugin is [just a function](https://github.com/rnpm/rnpm-plugin-link/blob/master/src/link.js#L81) which accepts `config` and `args` parameters. Every plugin consists of [public interface](https://github.com/rnpm/rnpm-plugin-link/blob/master/index.js) for CLI and [implementation intself](https://github.com/rnpm/rnpm-plugin-link/blob/master/src/link.js).

We use **public interface** to make your plugins auto-pluggable and easy to use for end-users. Every public interface consists of `name`, `func` & `description` fields:
- `name` - Name of the plugin. After plugin installation it'll be used as a command name. For instance plugin with following interface:
  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    func: require('./src/link'),
    description: 'This action updates your project and links all native dependencies',
    name: 'link [packageName]',
  };
  ```
  can be used like via rnpm like this:
  ```bash
  $ rnpm link
  ```

- `func` - Plugin itself. This function will be used when you run a command above
- `description` - Command description. If user runs `$ rnpm --help`, this field will be displayed as a command description.

Also, in the case you want to expose multiple commands from the one plugin, you may use an array syntax:
```javascript
module.exports = [{
  func: require('./src/link'),
  description: 'This action updates your project and links all native dependencies',
  name: 'link [packageName]',
}, {
  func: require('./src/unlink'),
  description: 'This action updates your project and unlink specific dependency',
  name: 'unlink <packageName>',
}]
```

#### Using third-party plugins

All existing plugins follows a naming convention: `rnpm-plugin-<plugin name>` (e.g. [`rnpm-plugin-link`]((https://github.com/rnpm/rnpm-plugin-link))). To include plugin to your rnpm build, just install it as a npm package, it'll be included to your rnpm tool automatically (wow, magic!). Let's consider following example: we have a `rnpm-plugin-something` plugin which we doesn't provide you automatically with `rnpm` tool. To install it manually, you need to run `npm install rnpm-plugin-something --save-dev` inside your project folder. Then, you can run it by `rnpm something` or check if command has been successfully installed by running `rnpm --help` - you should see a new plugin in the list of commands.

For further reading you can check our [example plugin](https://github.com/rnpm/rnpm-plugin-link)

### Commands
In the case you need an additional input from the user, you may make a `command` for this purpose. Commands works similar to the npm scripts.

*Depdendency's `package.json`:*
```json
"rnpm": {
  "commands": {
    "prelink": "./bin/requestGAToken",
    "postlink": "./bin/linkingSucceeded"
  }
}
```
In this scenario we're using custom `prelink` and `postlink` hooks for `rnpm-plugin-link` to tell `rnpm` that we want to run `prelink` script before and `postlink` after the linking process.

**Note:** `commands` may be async and require some user input using third-party libraries (inquirer for instance). You don't need to worry about async queues, we do it for you under the rnpm hood.

While making your own plugins for `rnpm` you may use any names for the commands, but we strongly recommend you to use a convention we suggest to avoid collisions: `when` + `plugin name`: `prelink` = `pre` + `link`.

### Developers

The documentation is still in progress, but if you are interested in the concept and good practices, see sample implementation [here](https://github.com/rnpm/rnpm-plugin-link/blob/master/index.js)

## Roadmap

First priority: **core elements**
- [ ] Test coverage
- [X] Plugins support

## FAQ

#### How's that different from react-native link

`react-native link` is great, but it only works for Android now. It also does not automatically add packages to your project nor support custom folder configuration. We aim to solve these issues by analyzing folders and getting maximum informations available from them. When running `rnpm link` you don't have to think about the package exported by developer or the import path to include in your Java project.

#### Does it work with CocoaPods?

Yes, in fact - it has nothing to do with it. What it does is just linking static libraries automatically to your xcodeproj in the normal way you have been doing that. There are no more other changes.

#### Can I use `rnpm link` with npm's postinstall hook?
Sure you can! Try doing something like this in your package.json:
```json
...
"scripts": {
  "postinstall": "rnpm link"
},
...
```

### `rnpm link <name>` fails with `ERRINVALIDPROJ`

Make sure you have run `npm install <name> --save` first

### `rnpm link` skip react-native module that it should not

To be as fast as possible, `rnpm link` gets list of modules to link from package.json's `dependencies`. If you have them in `devDependencies`, they are going to be skipped.

## Special thanks

Special thanks to [**coreh**](https://github.com/coreh) for giving us the `rnpm` name in the registry.

## Versioning

This project follows semver. There are several 0.x versions published to npm registry you should not install as they belong to the previous project that was using that name 2 years ago.

## Contributing

We welcome all contributors, simply make an issue or send over a pull request. We really appreciate your help - let's build this tool together!
